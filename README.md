### **Nifty50 and Bank Nifty Next-Day Prediction Research**

This repository focuses on the exploration and prediction of the next day's opening, high, low, and close prices for the **Nifty50** and **Bank Nifty** indices. Utilizing various machine learning models and statistical methods, this project aims to provide a research foundation for those interested in stock market forecasting. Given the highly volatile nature of the stock market, especially when influenced by news and external factors, accurate prediction is extremely challenging but not impossible.

### **Introduction**

Stock market index prediction has always been a subject of interest for financial analysts and traders. The volatility of indices like Nifty50 and Bank Nifty, combined with market psychology, news events, and global market trends, makes predicting price movements complex.

In this project, we utilized historical stock data and employed various predictive models to forecast future movements of the Nifty50 and Bank Nifty indices. Though the models work reasonably well under normal market conditions or during strong trends, their performance weakens when faced with reverse trends, large gap-ups, gap-downs, or unexpected market-moving news.

This repository provides an introduction to the methods and techniques used in stock market forecasting, along with suggestions for improvement in future work.

### **Models Used**

In this project, several machine learning and statistical models were tested and implemented:

1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly well-suited for time series data like stock prices.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode or mean prediction.
3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: An advanced boosting technique that aims to reduce bias and variance in models.
4. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A popular time series forecasting method used for non-stationary data.
5. **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**: An extension of ARIMA that includes seasonality, particularly helpful in capturing patterns that repeat over time.

The historical stock data was collected with the help of the `yfinance` library, which offers an easy-to-use API for downloading market data from Yahoo Finance. 

### **Prediction Challenges**

While our models were able to predict prices with a fair degree of accuracy during normal or trending markets, they failed to consistently capture correct movements during reverse trends or periods of high volatility. Some common pitfalls we identified were:

- **Reversing Trends**: When the market switches direction, especially after a prolonged trend, our models struggle to adjust quickly.
- **Gap-Ups and Gap-Downs**: Sudden movements that occur overnight (e.g., due to global news or economic announcements) are difficult to predict with past data alone.
- **News-Driven Movements**: External events, such as government policy changes or corporate earnings announcements, often cause unexpected price swings.
- **Special Days**: Events like holidays, budget announcements, and geopolitical developments introduce uncertainty, making predictions unreliable.

### **Possible Improvements**

To improve predictions in future iterations, we identified several areas to focus on:

1. **Feature Extraction and Enrichment**: 
   - Enhancing our dataset by incorporating global index data (such as S&P500 or FTSE) to capture global market sentiment.
   - Adding **news sentiment** analysis or identifying **special events** (e.g., earnings calls, policy announcements) to feed into the model.
   
2. **Data Granularity**: 
   - Currently, the dataset contains daily data. Feeding models with higher frequency data (e.g., minute-level or hour-level) may help in better pattern recognition and more accurate predictions.
   
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
   - Fine-tuning the models' hyperparameters to optimize prediction performance.
   
4. **Alternative Models**: 
   - Exploring other models such as **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, or even more sophisticated deep learning architectures like **Transformers**.
   
5. **Combining Models**: 
   - Ensembling multiple models to capture different aspects of price movements may lead to improved overall performance.

In summary, 60% of a good prediction comes from having the **right dataset**, and 40% depends on applying the **right models and logic**. The ultimate goal is to minimize prediction error by iteratively refining both the data and the models.

### **Is Stock Market Index Really Predictable?**

The question of whether stock market indices are truly predictable is a complex one. While it is relatively straightforward to identify general trends and draw trendlines, the real challenge lies in minimizing prediction error and adjusting for market anomalies like reversals or unexpected events. The goal is to bring your prediction boundaries closer to the actual market behavior while factoring in volatility.
